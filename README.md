### Abstract
AI is rapidly transforming diagnostic pathology, we present a new method for digital annotation using megakaryocytes (MKs) as a study case. MKs, responsible for platelet production, are diagnostically relevant but challenging to segment in H&E-stained bone marrow tissue sections due to their comparatively large size and complex morphology. We compared manual annotation with AI-driven segmentation using the Segment Anything Model (SAM) and SAM-corrected annotations. Our study demonstrated that SAM significantly accelerates annotation while maintaining accuracy. Using 2048×2048 tiles from 37 digitized, H&E-stained sections of diverse cellularity, we recorded annotation time and performance. SAM significantly accelerates annotations (20% faster for ground truth generation and 2 times faster for expert annotators), reducing workload while achieving comparable segmentation quality. This acceleration supports pathologists in quantitative morphology assessments, and provides a integrated solution for clinical adoption. Our open-source workflow establishes a standardized framework for AI-assisted annotation, paving the way for broader applications in histology.
